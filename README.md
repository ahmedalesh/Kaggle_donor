# Kaggle_donor

This project is based on https://www.kaggle.com/c/donorschoose-application-screening

It is a playground project. I would update this repo by using bert or gpt model to see how performance improves

To use this project, You would need to download the dataset from kaggle and place the data in a folder called 'data' in the root directory of the project.
